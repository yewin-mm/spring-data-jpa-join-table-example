## About The Project
This is the sample backend microservice project for join table by using spring data jpa.
You can learn how to connect and join two table by using spring data jpa.


### Built With
This project is built with
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/au/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Postgresql Database](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)


## Getting Started
This project is built with java, maven, postgresql and use project lombok as plugin.
So, please make sure all are installed in you machine.

### Before you begin
If you are new in Git, Github and new in Spring Boot configuration structure, <br>
You should see basic details instruction first in here
[Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction) <br>
If you are not good enough in basic JPA CRUD knowledge with Java Spring Boot, you should learn below example projects first. <br>
Click below links.
* [Spring Boot Sample CRUD Application](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-sample-crud)


If you already knew above links and you have good enough basic knowledge with Java Spring Boot, you can keep learn this project and see the "Instruction" below.


### Clone Project
* Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-data-jpa-join-table-example.git
  
### Prerequisites
Prerequisites can be found in here [Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction).


### Instruction
* Change your database username and password in `application.properties`.
* Run the project in your IDE. Please make sure application was successfully running.
* You can check in your database is that there has 'Role and User' table were auto created or not under postgres schema by database GUI tools like ***DBeaver***.
* Insert some data into 'Role' table in your database by querying in database console.
* Find 'Role' table under postgres schema which will auto create by running application. 
* If you can't find, just click refresh and see again under postgres schema.
* You can add by clicking '+' sign in your 'Role' table ***or*** you can run below query in DBeaver console (please go Execute SQL Statement in your DBeaver) like
  ```sh 
  insert into role (id, role_name) values (1, 'admin'); insert into role (id, role_name) values (2, 'normal user');

* Import `jpa-join-table-example-postman-api-request.json` file under project directory (see that file in project directory) into your installed Postman application.
    * Click in your Postman (top left corner) import -> file -> upload files -> {choose that json file} and open/import.
    * After that, you can see the folder which you import from file in your Postman.
    
* Now, you can 'Test' this project by calling API from Postman.
    * Open your imported folder in postman and inside this folder, you will see total of 3 API requests and you can test it all by clicking `Send` button and see the response.
    * Before testing, please make sure some data should be in `Role` table first. 
    * You can check data in database too (here you can check data in tables (User, Role) by DBeaver tools or you can manually select query in your database console)
    
* After that you can see the code and check the code which you don't know. You can learn it and you can apply in your job or study fields.

***Have Fun and Enjoy in Learning Code***
